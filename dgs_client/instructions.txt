Welcome to 4 Player Pong!

The player will receive a paddle 
dependent on which order they 
join the game.

P0 will appear on the bottom, P1 
will appear on top, P2 will 
appear to the left, and P3 will 
appear on the right

Objective:
- The objective of the game is to 
  have the LEAST amount of points at 
  the end of the game
- A player scores a point if the ball
  hits the player's wall

Instructions:
- Left and Right buttons allow players 
  to move their paddles
- If you are P2 or P3 left and right are
  treated as if you were of the same 
  orientation as P0
  (Keyboard shortcuts A and D can also be used)
- The player that starts the game MUST be
  P0 (the first player that joins the game) 
  and must not disconnect from the server 
  while the game is going on
